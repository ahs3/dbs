DONE:
=====
v0.5.0:
-- Moved the dbs task class to a separate module file
-- Gave in and set up proper Python packaging; really changes to tree
   structure for source files, and forces x.y.z versioning, but maybe
   useful in the long term
-- Added an ncurses UI (dbsui) on top of CLI (dbs)

v0.4.1:
-- added "todo" command: show only the projects with open/active tasks

v0.4:
-- added do_inactive() command (move from active to open)
-- updated do_active(), do_delete() to get_task()/put_task()
-- add a note each time I add/change/move/anything to a task
-- convert functions to use get_task()/put_task()
-- all commands that could operate on more than one task should be able to
-- added do_priority() and do_state() to list project summaries by priority
   and state, respectively
-- when adding a task, you can use the name 'next' and that will use the
   next sequence number
-- added an edit command

v0.3:
-- clean up ordering of functions in script (just getting messy)
-- command to raise/lower priority
      dbs up <name> ...
      dbs down <name> ...
-- command to duplicate a task
      dbs dup <from> <to>
